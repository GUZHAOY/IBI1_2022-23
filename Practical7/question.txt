Question: Will the total death rate of COVID-19 drop in China overtime?
Answer:line 63-74
I expected the rate to decrease slowly, however it was rising. This might be due to some inaccurate data
at the beginning of the pandemic. By that time, many officers tended to hide the real deaths and cases.
So the data was not completely correct. Also, it can be because COVID-19 death rate was not changing 
dramatically at first since the virus was not evolving so fast.
